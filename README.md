# HTML Audio and Video Player

This project is part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification.

## About the Project
A simple HTML5 audio and video player created to understand:
- Proper use of `<video>` and `<audio>` elements
- Using `<source>` tags with correct `src` and `type` attributes
- Media controls like play, pause, mute, and loop
- Basic semantic HTML structure using sections and headings

## Technologies Used
- HTML5

## What I Learned
- Difference between using `src` directly on media tags vs `<source>` elements
- Correct media type matching (`video/mp4`, `audio/mpeg`)
- Writing HTML that passes strict validation checks

## Live Preview
You can view the project by opening the `index.html` file in a browser.
